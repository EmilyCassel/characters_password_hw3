## Description 
The characters_password_hw3 allows the user to generate a password. The user must pick yes or no to lowercase etters, uppercase letters, numbers 0-9 and special characters. They also have to choose between 8 and 128 characters. The user is prompted to confirm yes or no and to put in how long they desire the password to be. 


## Motivation for Development 
The motivation behind the development was to develope a password generator that allowed the user to make choices but was still random. The hope is that this will make the password more secure. 

## User Story 
I want to be able to choose the password length as the user. I also want to be able to decide between having lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters. I also want the application to work without any glitches. 

## Technologies Used
I used technologies of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Challenges 
The main challenge I ran into was udnerstanding how to approach the problem. I also was more concerned with understanding what I was doing than actually turning the homework in. In addition I had the flu for a week so I did not get to the work until a bit after the classes. I also worked in the wrong repository at first. Once the project was finished I had to place it into the correct repository. I also had a hard time with the return button. 

## Successes 
I understand the material now. I also am understnading how the objects and arrays connect to each other. Also, it works. 


## Directions for Future Development 
Use on a website that needs a password
